# City-wise Air Quality & Pollution Risk Analysis

This project analyzes air quality data across cities to identify pollution trends, high-risk locations, and seasonal patterns using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze AQI trends over time
- Identify most polluted cities
- Categorize air quality levels
- Perform SQL-based aggregation and ranking
- Build dashboards for decision-makers

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQL (SQLite)
- Power BI
- GitHub
